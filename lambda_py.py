#Syntax
# x = lambda a : a + 10
# print(x(5))

# x = lambda a, b : a * b
# print(x(5, 6))

# x = lambda a, b, c : a + b + c
# print(x(5, 6, 2))


#Why Use Lambda Functions?
# The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.
# Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown number:

def myfunc(n):
  return lambda a : a * n

mydoubler = myfunc(2)
print(mydoubler(11))



def myfunc(n):
  return lambda a : a * n

mydoubler = myfunc(2)
mytripler = myfunc(3)

print(mydoubler(11))
print(mytripler(11))
